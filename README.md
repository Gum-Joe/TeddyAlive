The way to make teddies alive
# How to use
First, download and run Teddy alive setup using the following command: `java -jar TeddyAliveSetup.jar` in an empty folder.
It can be ran on a Windows PC, Mac and rasberry pi but to use commands such as Move forwards, you need the correct configuration of a rasberry pi to use TeddyAlive (not avalible - coming soon).


# Running it
Simply type: `java -jar ./bin/TeddyAlive.jar` or `Start.sh`


When you are prompt to type a command, type it and see the output. Currently working on sounds and more.
